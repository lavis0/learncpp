# C++ Fundamentals

To compensate for my lack of care when initially understanding coding languages (such as Java and C) in the past, I aim to use [***learncpp***](https://www.learncpp.com) as a tool to cover a programming language in detail.

C++ was chosen under the following criteria:

1. there are several similar, and popular, languages such as C, C# and Java
2. there is plenty of documentation and educational resources
3. it's a compiled language that can have low latency
4. it's relationship with many hardware components (drivers, FPGAs, etc.)

## Methodology

Firstly, I will read and note each chapter summary. Once a given chapter summary is copied, I will work through the chapter, adding to the summary where I feel is necessary. In this step, I may produce additional documents or pieces of code, which shall be stored in a corresponding folder for future reference.

## Chapter Summaries

For convenience, chapter summaries can be accessed below:\
[Chapter 1 - Basic Syntax](chaps/chap01_basic_syntax.md)\
[Chapter 2 - Functions and Files](chaps/chap02_func_n_files.md)\
[Chapter 3 - Debugging](chaps/chap03_debugging.md)\
[Chapter 4 - Fundamental Data Types](chaps/chap04_fundamental_data_types.md)\
[Chapter 5 - Constants and Strings](chaps/chap05_const_n_string.md)\
[Chapter 6 - Standard Operators](chaps/chap06_operators.md)\
[Chapter 7 - Scope, Duration and Linkage](chaps/chap07_scope_duration_linkage.md)\
[Chapter 8 - Control Flow](chaps/chap08_control_flow.md)\
[Chapter 9 - Assertions and Error Handling](chaps/chap09_testing.md)\
[Chapter 10 - Type Conversions, Aliases and Deduction](chaps/chap10_type_conversion_alias_deduct.md)
