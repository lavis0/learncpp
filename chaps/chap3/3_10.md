# Don’t make errors

Well, the best thing is to not make errors in the first place. Here’s a list of things that can help avoid making errors:

Follow best practices.
1. Don’t program when tired or frustrated. Take a break and come back later.
2. Understand where the common pitfalls are in a language (all those things we warn you not to do).
3. Don’t let your functions get too long.
4. Prefer using the standard library to writing your own code, when possible.
5. Comment your code liberally.
6. Start with simple solutions, then layer in complexity incrementally.
7. Avoid clever/non-obvious solutions.
8. Optimize for readability and maintainability, not performance.


# Key Points for Finding Issues Before They Become Problems

- **Enable and Heed Compiler Warnings:**  
    Treat compiler warnings as errors to catch potential issues early.

- **Utilize Static Analysis Tools:**  
    Regularly run static analysis to identify problematic code patterns before they cause runtime issues.

- **Adopt Defensive Programming:**  
    Write code that anticipates potential pitfalls and handles unexpected conditions gracefully.

- **Keep Code Readable and Maintainable:**  
    Clear, well-organized code makes it easier to spot errors and prevents problems as the project grows.

- **Practice Incremental Testing:**  
    Integrate unit tests and continuous integration to catch issues as soon as they appear.

- **Learn from Common Pitfalls:**  
    Familiarize yourself with common C++ mistakes and best practices to avoid recurring issues.
